Introduction
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element inserted is the first to be removed. It is widely used in programming for managing function calls, undo/redo operations, and expression evaluation. A stack can be implemented using arrays or linked lists and supports basic operations such as push (insertion), pop (deletion), peek (viewing the top element), and isEmpty (checking if the stack is empty). Understanding stacks is essential for solving various computational problems efficiently.

Objectives
By studying stacks, you will:

Understand the LIFO principle and how it governs stack operations.
Learn to implement stacks using arrays and linked lists.
Explore real-world applications of stacks, such as recursion, backtracking, and memory management.
Perform stack operations, including push, pop, peek, and checking for stack emptiness.
Analyze the time and space complexity of stack operations.
Apply stacks to solve algorithmic problems, such as balancing parentheses and evaluating expressions.
